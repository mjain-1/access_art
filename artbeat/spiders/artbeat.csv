Over the course of his influential four-decade career, Kelley generated a remarkably diverse oeuvre in an array of mediums, conflating high and low culture, critiquing prevailing aesthetic conventions and colliding the sacred with the profane. Comprised of some 100 Memory Wares and associated works made between 2000 and 2010, the Memory Ware series occupies a prominent place in Kelleyâ€™s materially and conceptually complex output. It includes two- and three-dimensional pieces: wall works known as Memory Ware Flats and freestanding sculptures. The exhibition at Hauser & Wirth will showcase almost two dozen Memory Ware works, most on loan from museums and significant international private collections.","On view through 23 December, â€˜Memory Wareâ€™ will coincide with the release of the first ever book to document Kelleyâ€™s entire Memory Ware series. This volume, published by Hauser & Wirth Publishers in association with the Mike Kelley Foundation for the Arts, features an essay by Ralph Rugoff, Director of the Hayward Gallery, London, offering a fresh analysis of the Memory Ware series and its position within Kelleyâ€™s practice.Ralph Rugoff on Mike Kelleyâ€™s Memory Ware Series
Mike Kelleyâ€™s Memory Ware series embodies the thematic engagement with memory-related concerns that informed the second half of the artistâ€™s career. Beginning with such projects as Educational Complex (1995), a model conflating his recollections of the design of his childhood home and every school he attended, and Categorical Imperative (1999), a sprawling installation that re-contextualized leftover production materials from 20 years of art-making, Kelley devoted himself to exploring conventions of remembering, representing, and reconstructing the past. Fuelled by a deeply felt antipathy toward nostalgia, and incorporating references to personal, folk, and collective histories, these works were formally realized in ways that evoked tropes of modernist aesthetic practice and theory, while critically reflecting on the criteria and categories through which recent art historical memory has been forged.Kelley borrowed the phrase â€˜memory wareâ€™ from a type of folk art popular in black communities of the American South and in Victorian Britain, in which the surfaces of common household vessels â€“ bottles, vases, lamps â€“ are covered with such small personal items and keepsakes as keys, buttons, shells, and beads in a matrix of clay. Kelley first encountered examples of the genre at a Toronto antiques fair in 2000, where he purchased a memory ware bottle. Given his existing interest in remembrance and in re-purposing materials with prior histories, as well as his long-term engagement with the aesthetics of craft and folk art, Kelley recognized in this find the possibilities
for developing new works that deployed the memory ware aesthetic towards very different ends.At first glance, the Memory Ware project would appear to be an anomaly in Kelleyâ€™s oeuvre. In place of the caustic wit and satirical orientation that characterized much of his output, the Memory Ware Flats in particular appear to emphasize decorative surface effects and to maintain a content-neutral demeanor. But the borrowed aesthetic Kelley deployed in the series is best understood as part of a labyrinth in which intricate paths of ideas and allusions intersect and circle back upon one another. In making the Memory Ware sculptures and paintings, Kelley elaborated on artistic strategies he had developed throughout his career: contrasting and playing with conventions to reveal their role in generating and framing different meanings, and cross-wiring readymade categories to confound our expectations. Underlying his approach was a deeply felt opposition to any idealist assertion that objects â€“ including works of art â€“ have inherent significance or value. Instead, Kelleyâ€™s Memory Wares reveal that, as philosopher Slavoj Å_iÅ_ek has observed, in different contexts â€˜the same object can function successively as a disgusting reject and as a sublime, charismatic apparition; the difference, strictly structural, does not pertain to the â€˜effective propertiesâ€™ of the object, but only to its place in the symbolic order.â€™Kelleyâ€™s Memory Ware project can also be understood as an extended chapter in the artistâ€™s long engagement with reusing, repurposing, and re-contextualizing materials and ideas, including those associated with his own earlier production. In this respect, the Memory Ware series provides extraordinary evidence of Kelleyâ€™s efforts to destabilize or subvert the historical reception, remembrance, and memorialization of his own work. With the Memory Ware series, he invites the viewer to reflect upon the ways in which artâ€™s meaning is always in play. As it comes to be seen within new contexts and different historical frameworks, an artistâ€™s oeuvre will inevitably change and evolve in our mindsâ€™ eyes.",Hauser & Wirth,"32 E 69th St., New York, NY 10021",,Mike Kelley â€œMemory Wareâ€ù,"from November 03, 2016 to December 23, 2016","This yearâ€™s Fair will gather over 40 exhibitors from around the US, Europe, and South Africa showing their latest publications at The Tunnel in New Yorkâ€™s Chelsea.

The most characteristic features of kimono ornamentation made in this way are the subtle color gradations and narrow, flowing light lines that outline the motifs.","Chika MacDonald was influenced by the Great East Japanese Earthquake and Tsunami of 2011. The only way she could sympathize with those affected was to send her daily prayers. One day while she was praying, an image of a dragon appeared on her mental canvas.

The Berlin- and New York-based artist has, since the 1970â€™s, developed a multi-disciplinary body of work exploring models of representation, knowledge, communication, and organization.

For this exhibition, Mullican creates a densely immersive installation from three work types: five large banners that form a corridor within the gallery space; two large walls of new rubbings on painted canvas hung nearly floor to ceiling; and a new expansive work comprised of 535 individual pages, displayed across 16 tables: Man and his Symbols, after the final book written by Swiss psychotherapist Carl Jung.

The five orders of the artistâ€™s own cosmology are the basis of the five banners, which were first shown in his 2013 solo exhibition at the Museo Tamayo in Mexico City. Their bold colors and seemingly straightforward design echo the inundation of images we encounter dailyâ€”signage and icons meant to communicate quickly, directly, and universally. A recurring medium in his practice, the banner has been fascinating to Mullican for its ubiquity across cultures and throughout time.

Junctures, connections, and pathways are the main subjects of the rubbings; their images, culled from sources spanning the nineteenth century to the present, include trains, stations, tracks, and charts. Language and communication are central as well; for example, one rubbing features the typeface Mullican designed from a geometry he has used since the 1970â€™s and has incorporated in his work ever since. Their makingâ€”with acrylic gouache and oil stick on canvasâ€”is a mechanical process based on transfer and reproduction, and at their core the rubbings reflect Mullicanâ€™s project of investigating systems of communication and conveyance, and the gap between the thing and its symbolic representation. Mullicanâ€™s entire body of these rubbings, begun in 1984, was recently documented in a comprehensive catalogue raisonnÃ©

Mullicanâ€™s Man & His Symbols includes every image from Jungâ€™s book (which was published posthumously in 1964), cut out and collaged on pages in the order in which they appeared, each page numbered twice by the artist: one number represents the imageâ€™s page number in Jungâ€™s book, the other the page in Mullicanâ€™s book. The bookâ€™s original chapter headings, also on single sheets, are interspersed on similarly numbered sheets.","Matt Mullican was born in Santa Monica, California, in 1951 and lives and works in Berlin and New York. He has had many solo exhibitions at important international museums including Kunstmuseum Winterthur (2016), Museo Tamayo, Mexico City (2013), Haus der Kunst, Munich (2011), and Institut dâ€™Art Contemporain, Villeurbanne (2010), among many others. The artistâ€™s works can be found in major public collections: Museum of Modern Art, New York; The Whitney Museum of American Art, New York; MusÃ©e National dâ€™Art Moderne - Centre Pompidou, Paris; Fonds National dâ€™Art Contemporain, Paris; Museo National Centro de Arte Reina Sofia, Madrid; Castello di Rivoli, Turin; Kunstmuseum Luzern, Lucerne, and many more.

The second venue of his major exhibition Nothing Should Exist, opens 5 November at Kunsthalle Vogelmann, Heilbronn. Pirelli HangarBicoccia, Milan, will present a major Mullican exhibition in spring 2018.

hard-edged abstract paintings from the early 1960s by Helen Lundeberg.
This is the galleryâ€™s first exhibition of Lundebergâ€™s work.

Helen Lundeberg was a leading figure of west coast abstraction in the
post-war era. An active painter and writer, she was at the epicenter of a
dynamic group of Los Angeles artists and critics that included Lorser Feitelson,
Karl Benjamin, Jules Langsner, John McLaughlin, and Frederick Hammersley.
Along with her peers, Lundebergâ€™s work formed the core of what later became
known as California hard-edged painting. Although her contributions to
American abstraction have long been recognized on the west coast,
Lundeberg has yet to receive her due in the east.

In the 1960s Lundeberg created a body of work considered to be her finest
and most distinct. Distilled to essential elements of line, color, and space, her
hard-edged paintings from this period effect a coherence of composition that
borders on the sublime. Classic Attitude presents a selection of paintings from
this moment, featuring works that are united by their compositional balance,
subtleties of color, and pictorial refinement. The title of the exhibition derives
from a statement Lundeberg wrote for a 1942 exhibition at MoMA:","By classicism I mean, not traditionalism of any sort, but a highly
conscious concern with esthetic structure which is the antithesis
of intuitive, romantic, or realistic approaches to painting. My aim,
realized or not, is to calculate, and reconsider, every element in
a painting with regard to its function in the whole organization.
That, I believe, is the classic attitude.[1]

Lundebergâ€™s attention to formal elements such as balance and color connect
her to a previous generation of abstract artists, including Henri Matisse, Piet
Mondrian, and Josef Albers. Similarly, her reductive forms, flat surfaces, and
spare compositions link her to contemporaries such as Ad Reinhardt,
Ellsworth Kelly, and Agnes Martin. But unlike these other artists, Lundebergâ€™s
vision of abstraction remained connected to the world around her. In Desert
Road, Lundebergâ€™s flat, unmodulated swaths of color coalesce to form the
view suggested by the paintingâ€™s title. Dramatic landscapes and architectural
vistas such as these were composed of forms rememberedâ€”things â€œimagined
rather than â€˜seen,â€™â€ù as she stated later in life.[2] The works presented in
Classic Attitude encapsulate Lundebergâ€™s unique approach, and underscore
her rightful place in the art historical canon.

Helen Lundeberg (1908-1999) was born in Chicago and graduated from
Pasadena City College in 1930. She co-founded the movement Subjective
Classicism, also known as Post Surrealism, before becoming an integral part
of the west coast abstract circle. In spring 2016 The Laguna Art Museum
presented a retrospective of her work. She has also had solo exhibitions at
The Fresno Art Museum, Los Angeles County Museum of Art, University Art
Museum in Santa Barbara, Long Beach Museum of Art, and Santa Barbara
Museum of Art. Her work is included in the permanent collections of The Los
Angeles County Museum of Art, Smithsonian American Art Museum, Norton
Simon Museum, San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, Laguna Art Museum,
Museum of Contemporary Art in San Diego, Museum of Fine Arts in Boston,

Supposedly, she represents eternal beauty and perfection; however, the work is derived from a Heinrich Hoffmann photographâ€”a German propaganda image of a marble sculpture from the 1930s. A second picture in this gallery space closes in on an artist standing high atop a ladder, chiseling the head of a giant sculpture. Josef Thorak, Hitlerâ€™s most admired sculptor has been a source for various works by Brauntuch, who appropriated images of disinformation back in the 1970s when he was a member of the Pictures Generation, and sets the stage for this, Brauntuchâ€™s sixth solo exhibition at Petzel.","Also in the 1930s, but working in the States, the British-born fashion designer, Charles James, known as â€œAmericaâ€™s First Couturierâ€ù viewed his sculptured ball gowns and evening dresses as works of art. Jamesâ€™ precisely constructed designs were the subject of a 2014 exhibition at The Metropolitan Museum of Art. After photographing the displays at night, Brauntuch selected five dressesâ€”Swan, Butterfly, Tree, Clover Leaf, Wedding gownâ€”and used these sources to create paintings that are slightly oversized relative to the original luxury items. If these renderings evoke a bygone era of elegance and style, they are now frozen as exquisite objects, absent a human body, phantoms of opulence.June 15, 1995, O.J. Simpson attempts to slip on the bloodied gloves found behind his Rockingham Drive Estate. The courtroom explodes, the media erupt, and images of the gloves circulate endlessly throughout Simpsonâ€™s trial and for years to come, forever cemented into the American consciousness. Six double panels focus on this pair of gloves in extreme close-up as amplified signifiers of guilt or innocence, formatting an almost ghost-like dance and accordingly arranged on the gallery walls in a cinematic succession.Brauntuchâ€™s pictures revisit this dramatic public event but his signature applications in chalk on black cloth force an almost intimate and microscopic perception. The delicate hues and shades evoke an inner reflection, more the memory of an image than the presentation of such. A chilling atmosphere of crime, decadence and slaughter have haunted Brauntuchâ€™s oeuvre for four decades, betrayed by his extraordinary touch and skill for rendering pictures of violence and decay in the most beautiful, elegiac manner.",Petzel Gallery,"456 W 18th St., New York, NY 10011",,Troy Brauntuch Exhibition,"from November 03, 2016 to December 23, 2016","Visitors have an unrivaled opportunity to view and acquire outstanding works across the diverse range of periods and specialties represented by the IFPDAâ€™s exhibiting members.

The shapeshifting works hang on the walls at eye level, facing us head-on, perfectly posited to torment, taunt, or seduce. Indifferent, they choose to keep mum.","Fiberglass and epoxy, adaptable industrial materials, dry to a sturdy finish that confers a density to the works and belies their hollow interior. Tarp laid down during the casting process imprints wrinkles and folds on the surface, lending a deceptively plush appearance to the hard, unyielding shell. And if the glossy wall-mounted works recall the lineage of painting-cum-sculpture, there is no painterly trace: resin adheres to paint that has been applied to the mold, coating the work in color in one immediate, irreversible swoop. The illusive fragility of the final work is a remnant of this delicate mold, constructed of cardboard and tape.The works run the gamut from the familiar or representational to the purely abstract. But they do not occupy a space between the two polesâ€”they span them, alternatively begetting and resisting figuration.A silhouette is a hint of a thing. Boccato collects the outlines of objects, stripping them of narrative, context, and ownership. He has repurposed the found shapes to create the monochromatic sculptures in â€œcreepers,â€ù each only vaguely reminiscent of something. Protruding elements, dimples, and depressions on the plastic surfaces grin back at us at first, indexing grimaces or sneers. In a double take, the human reference is lost and we are reminded that these, too, are forms.Daniel Boccato was born in 1991 in Campinas, Brazil, and currently lives and works in New York.

The artistâ€™s third exhibition at the gallery, River and Sky, will feature new large-scale light boxes and a suite of gelatin silver prints taken in Flint, Michigan, paired with recent works from his Night Skies series made with cocaine and black velvet.","In two new bodies of work Stepping Stone Falls and Bridges over Flint, Brandt pivots away from the natural world of bees, trees, lakes and reservoirs that comprised both the materials and subjects of his previous series, towards the built environments of Flint, Michigan. Having visited and worked in Flint shortly after its water crisis was uncovered, the artist was struck by the contrast of the solid, Brutalist architecture of Flintâ€™s dam at Stepping Stone Falls, a manufactured waterfall, with the natural flow of the river running through it. After photographing the Falls, Brandt color-separated the large-scale photographs onto three individual Duraclear sheets and placed them in a pump system with the collected Flint River water continuously flowing over each, wearing away the images and creating fluid patterns of erosion. After several weeks, the artist reassembled the cyan, magenta and yellow layers in an LED light box typically used for retail display signage or commercial advertisements. Each is a depiction of the original scene of moving water, partially created by moving water, continuing the artistâ€™s interest in fusing a photographâ€™s subject with its medium.River and Sky will also include Bridges over Flint, a collection of 24 gelatin silver prints depicting the cityâ€™s multiple bridges by which the Flint River is traversed and bypassed. The 8â€ù x 10â€ù photographs are developed with the water drawn through household taps in Flint, along with lead and other contaminants that pervade the cityâ€™s water supply. The unknown and varied effects of these impurities on the prints mirror the uncertainty the water represents to the residents. Depending on the length of submersion and ingredients such as Vitamin C, bleach or red wine added by Brandt to the water, the prints are graded in tone and installed in order from light to dark.In contrast to the specific location of Flint, Michigan, the exhibition broadens in scope to the dimensions of the universe. In the series Night Skies, the artist compresses the expanses of cosmic space into the sphere of human activity by recreating photographs of distant galaxies with the unconventional materials of cocaine on black photographerâ€™s velvet. Addressing the far- reaching history of astronomic illustration, and suggestive of the perceptual distortions necessary to comprehend the vastness of the universe, Night Skies presents a material exploration of the boundaries between what is observed and what is imagined. Each circular piece is named for the astronomical body depicted according to its number in the New General Catalogue of Nebulae and Clusters of Stars (NGC), an attempt begun in the 19th-century to organize infinity and understand the unknown.Work by Matthew Brandt is in the permanent collections of Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York; National Gallery of Art, Washington, DC; J. Paul Getty Museum, Los Angeles; Brooklyn Museum, New York; Art Gallery of South Wales, Sydney, Australia; Virginia Museum of Fine Arts, Richmond; Cincinnati Art Museum; Los Angeles County Museum of Art; Hammer Museum, Los Angeles; Royal Danish Library, National Museum of Photography, Copenhagen; and the Columbus Museum of Art, among others.

The galleryâ€™s second exhibition with the Chinese artist will be shown in both its New York locations. Each space will feature an installation alongside new paintings in which Liu Wei continues his examination of the physiological and psychological conditions that shape reality.

Over the past two decades, Liu Wei has resisted commitment to a specific medium or way of making, choosing instead to work with a wide range of media that facilitates the conceptual nature of his work. While many of his paintings, sculptures, installations, and videos reference Chinese culture and its modern landscape, his focus lies in universal issues affecting contemporary society, such as the transformative effect of urbanization on the landscape and unbalanced hierarchies of authority. Liu Wei approaches these concepts with an open mind, without imparting a particular political line of thinking. As part of the post-Mao generation, the artist has expressed how the rapid development of China and the constant shifting of ideology and values created an uncertain state of reality, which has deeply informed his artistic pursuits. Central to Liu Weiâ€™s practice is his manipulation and alteration of perception as a tool to create environments where viewers encounter a complex and varied existence.

For his sculptural installation at 536 West 22nd Street, Liu Wei was inspired by the Jorge Luis Borges poem Mirrors (1960), particularly the segment that reads, â€œâ€_Everything happens and nothing is recorded, In these rooms of the looking glassâ€_.â€ù The monumental sculptureâ€”comprised of mirrors that form a single, floating boxâ€”passes through walls and blocks off established pathways of the gallery as a way to drastically alter the existing architecture and the experience of the space. For Liu Wei, the presence of the viewer, who will be able to circumnavigate the box, is as important to the installation as the physical and material characteristics of the sculpture. The piece is intended to provoke a phenomenological experience of space that can be only activated by the viewer.

Architecture has long been a source of inspiration for the artist, as one of the defining characteristics of both modernity and urbanism. This is echoed in the gray monochromatic paintings also installed at West 22nd Street. The thick, tactile impasto of oil paint applied like rough plaster to the canvas recalls industrial building materials, while a series of metal bars installed in front of the paintings creates a visual and conceptual disruption to the viewing experience. This metal barrier, like the mirrored sculpture, provides a framing structure for the paintings, while also activating the viewerâ€™s awareness of their physical presence within the space, as a consumer of visual information.

At Chrystie Street, Liu Wei builds upon his concern for activating space with a complex installation composed of objects made from military canvas, metal, and wood. Surrounding the installation is a series of colorful, irregularly shaped paintings on steel that resemble views of the horizon. This entire installation is intimately linked to Liu Weiâ€™s fascination with the ways technology has enhanced and altered our understanding of the world. His representation is fragmented and disjointed in a way that mimics how we receive and process information. Liu Weiâ€™s work suggests that the illusion of a panoramic view of the world drastically alters our own perception of reality, which is no longer simply informed by our immediate locale.","Liu Wei (b. 1972, Beijing; lives and works in Beijing) graduated from the National Academy of Fine Arts, Hangzhou in 1996.

Shields relied on word-of-mouth to find contributors, the way women have transmitted stories and information throughout the ages. Participants took selfies in the privacy of their own homes or at open house events in a photo booth Shields created out of a plastic storage shed.A private group was set up on Facebook creating a safe space for members to share information about feminism, womenâ€™s health and sexuality. This group became known as Project â€œSâ€ù. As support and interest grew, one member created Project â€œSâ€ù tee shirts with proceeds going to a local non-profit benefiting women. A powerful development of this project has been the birth of a space for participants to speak of body image issues that surfaced as they took their selfies. In a time of vaginal contouring and aesthetic labiaplasty, Shields came to see her drawings as an affirmation that each vulva is beautiful and unique.Her drawings are exhibited without fixative or protective framing, remaining as exposed as the women who volunteered to share their selfies.",Ceres Gallery,"547 W 27th St., Suite 201, New York, NY 10001",,Pamela Shields â€œProject â€˜Sâ€™â€ù,"from November 01, 2016 to November 26, 2016","Carter Burden Gallery presents three new exhibitions: Crime and Passion in the east gallery featuring Marilyn Church, About New York in the west gallery featuring Lindsay, and On the Wall featuring Claire Boren.","In Crime and Passion, Marilyn Church presents eight of her historic courtroom drawings with six of her recent paintings in her first exhibition at Carter Burden Gallery. The exhibition highlights the artistâ€™s recent work while also recognizing her career as a courtroom artist for The New York Times. Her courtroom drawings capture key moments in some of the most sensational criminal trials in New Yorkâ€™s history. These very public drawings, Church says, helped inspire her more personal paintings: â€œThe very real narratives of the defendantsâ€™ lives led me to examine more intensely my own narrative and how to portray it in my painting.â€ù Marilyn Churchâ€™s recent works focus on the abstraction of the figure. The result is mysterious and ambiguous, an intriguing contrast with the realism of the dramatic courtroom drawings.

Marilyn Church, born 1940 in New York City, is a painter. Church has taught at Pratt Institute and FIT and has been a courtroom artist for The New York Times & television stations. She has a BFA from Pratt Institute and has done MFA work at Indiana University and Pratt Institute. She has also studied at the School of Visual Arts and the Art Students League. Churchâ€™s drawings have been collected by both the Smithsonian Institute and the Library of Congress, which has 4,500 of her pieces in their archives. She has shown extensively in New York City and on the East End of Long Island. Some of her solo shows have been at The Julian Beck Gallery in Bridgehampton, NY, and The Bernaducci Meisel and the Roger Smith Gallery in NYC. Noteworthy group exhibits include: Uprise Gallery, The Brucennial and Peter Marcelle Gallery. Guild Hall Museum awarded her Best Mixed Media Artist in 2008. She has received a NY Press Art Award and an Emmy for her courtroom work. The Art of Justice, a book of her art, was published by Quirk Books in 2006.

Lindsay

In About New York, Lindsay presents recent paintings and drawings for her second exhibition at Carter Burden Gallery. The artistâ€™s style is best described as folk expressionist stemming from abstract expressionism. Lindsayâ€™s paintings are based on her sketches of daily life in New York. Throughout the day, the artist draws the people of New York from life and from her memory in her pocket sketchbook. Upon returning to her studio, she redraws the sketch onto a larger 22â€ù x 30â€ù piece of paper. Later, she selects specific scenes to paint. In the paintings, color and form transform the imagery. Through this body of work, the artist shares her unique take on the colors, shapes, and people that are New York.

Lindsay, b. 1937, earned her BA from Carnegie Mellon University and her masterâ€™s degree from Maryland Institute College of Art where she studied with Grace Hartigan. Lindsay has exhibited her work extensively for over fifty years. She continues to actively show in New York. She founded and has worked as the director of a cooperative and taught at the school of Art & Design in Philadelphia. Lindsay lives in New York City.

Claire Boren

Claire Borenâ€™s On the Wall installation consists of a large mixed media work titled Possibilities of an Endless Journey. The installation represents the artistâ€™s visual exploration of aging and time. Through this work, the artist examines that despite the physical limitations that come with growing older, the mind is continuing to grow intellectually, creatively, and emotionally. Borenâ€™s work is deeply connected to the past, and her art relates to her childhood trauma. The artist focuses on the emotion of her reaction and works in an explosive and spontaneous manner.

Claire Boren, b. 1938, received her BA from Queens College and her MS from Columbia University. In addition, she studied at The New School and the Arts Student League. Boren has studied with Isaac Sawyer and Richard Diamond. Boren began working with abstraction in 1995, after many years of creating realistic and figurative work. Making the shift to abstract work in mixed media allowed her to translate her interior world into the exterior one through her art. Boren was surprised at how her art-making process unlocked past experiences and memories of her childhood during the Holocaust. In Poland during World War II, from October 1942 to the spring of 1944, Boren and her mother survived by hiding in houses, attics, a forest, and a hole in the ground under a pig barn for three months. The artist has shown extensively in New York and New Jersey.",Carter Burden Gallery,"548 W 28th St., #534, New York, NY 10001",,"Marilyn Church, Lindsay and Claire Boren Exhibition","from November 01, 2016 to November 22, 2016","Margaret Levesonâ€™s exhibition, â€œWaterwaysâ€ù will be held at Blue Mountain Gallery. It will be her 19th solo exhibition. Leveson is primarily a landscape painter, painting on site whenever possible. There are many recurrent themes in her work, important amongst them that of water, the focus of the present exhibition.","Many of the paintings were executed around her country home in the Catskills where she and her husband live half of the year. About Levesonâ€™s 2015 solo exhibition of Catskill paintings, the Catskill historian Bill Birns wrote: â€œSome things say â€˜I have been to Italy,â€™ Margaret Levesonâ€™s work says â€˜I am the Catskills.â€™â€ù Other paintings are the result of trips to New Mexico and Arizona, places with which she has become familiar through repeated visits over the years with her geologist husband.Margaret Leveson grew up in Canada spending summers in Algonquin Park, Ontario, the stumping ground of Canadian painter Tom Thompson. He was an early influence on her work. Leveson got a BA from the University of Toronto in Fine Arts and, after working at the Vancouver Art Gallery, moved to New York City where she settled and obtained an MFA in Fine Arts from Brooklyn College. In 1980, she was a founding member of Blue Mountain Gallery, New York City, where she continues to exhibit through to today.

Kassayâ€™s new sculptures explore these systems in which architecture both latently shapes and eludes conscious sense. This rote coding of gestures causes the awareness of oneâ€™s surroundings to slowly erode, with familiarity superseding reflection. Thickening the peripheral features and interstices of interior space that are routinely used but disregarded, Kassay reframes how attention is built into its surroundings.Three architectonic sculptures within the exhibition terminate in dead ends and reroute oneâ€™s circulation through the gallery. Modeled on separate stairwells at 1:1 scale, these works present corridors whose connective function is severed, neither ascending nor descending. These disconnected passages form a series of transitions that hover in an architectural uncanny, somewhere between model and fragment, calculated rendering and lived space.

Railings are affixed along the gallery wall, framing it as a transited space. These supports are lined with Braille characters without syntax, extruding the eponymous letters of the exhibition - H for one, L for the other. This fixed-scale language communicates nothing other than prehensible vocalizations: embedded sighs and inaudible drones which trail off into space.Jacob Kassay was born in 1984 in Lewiston, New York.

Featuring some 180 works depicting Nixon and his cronies, the exhibition includes Gustonâ€™s infamous Poor Richard series and brings together over 100 additional drawings and one painting never before seen by the public at large. The exhibition marks the first time this entire body of work has been presented together to the public.","These trenchant works were created at an historic moment, amidst the tumultuous political climate of the early 1970s, as the United States suffered under the weight of civil unrest and social dissent following the assassinations of Martin Luther King Jr and Senator Robert F Kennedy, the chaos of the 1968 presidential election, and the enduring violence and brutality of the Vietnam War. In his studio in Woodstock NY, Gustonâ€™s distress over the political situation was fueled by conversations with his friend, the writer Philip Roth. The artist and the writer shared an intellectual disposition for the mundane â€˜crapolaâ€™ of American popular culture, and in Nixon discovered a subject they could each mimic and animate in art. During the summer of 1971, Roth had recently completed â€˜Our Gang,â€™ an outlandish political satire of the Nixon administration. Putting pen to paper, Guston similarly engaged in an artistic pursuit of the embattled President, turning toward the immediacy of drawing and reveling in the power of expressive line. The works in â€˜Laughter in the Darkâ€™ can be viewed within the distinguished tradition of political satire and social commentary by such artists as Hogarth, Daumier, Goya, and Picasso. Seeking a language to resolve a pictorial crisis that was at once personally and politically engaged, Gustonâ€™s adaptation of the comic-strip style of caricature emerged at a pivotal crux in his artistic career.On view through 14 January 2017, â€˜Philip Guston: Laughter in the Dark, Drawings from 1971 & 1975â€™ is cocurated by Sally Radic, of The Guston Foundation, and Musa Mayer, the daughter of the artist. The exhibition is the first to be presented in Hauser & Wirthâ€™s new temporary space at 548 West 22nd Street. The exhibition is accompanied by a brief chronology that serves to remind viewers of the â€˜highlightsâ€™ of Nixonâ€™s career.In May 1971, Philip Guston returned from an eight-month sojourn in Italy following the scathing critical response to his October 1970 Marlborough Gallery exhibition in New York. That first showing of his late paintings had been assailed by critics and admirers of high Modernism as an act of heresy, a full-fledged betrayal of abstract painting. Unraveled and deflated by attacks from critics like Hilton Kramer, who publicly denounced Guston as â€˜A Mandarin Pretending to Be a Stumblebumâ€™ (the headline of his biting New York Times review), the artist lamented the art worldâ€™s rigidity. â€˜It was as though I had left the Church,â€™ he stated at the time. â€˜I was excommunicated.â€™ Less than one year later, Guston would return to the US with his immersion in figuration and the aesthetic of transgression only reinforced by criticism, now replete with the grotesque and the absurd.The works on view in â€˜Philip Guston: Laughter in the Dark, Drawings from 1971 & 1975â€™ were created at this pivotal moment of Gustonâ€™s personal and artistic journey. The exhibition opens with â€˜Aloneâ€™ and â€˜In Bed II,â€™ two paintings from 1971 that culminate Gustonâ€™s outpouring of satirical Nixon images over the months of July and August that same year. Developed through the language of caricature, these works propose a new pictorial order that conveys both the pathos of a fraught inner terrain and the impossible turmoil of the exterior world. Each painting renders a solitary figure lying awake in bed, caught in an introspective state of contemplation and foreboding. These pictorial compositions suggest parallels between images of the young Nixon rendered in Gustonâ€™s Poor Richard series and the artistâ€™s revealing self-portraits of later years. The lexicon of images that first animated his Nixon drawings, here begins to substantiate the themes and iconography that give such potency to his late work. The exhibition continues in three subsequent rooms where viewers will find the artistâ€™s never-before-exhibited Nixon drawings and the Poor Richard narrative from 1971, as well as works from The Phlebitis Series from 1975.Guston shared great contempt with Philip Roth for the newly elected Richard Nixon. This unwavering sentiment would intensify when The New York Times and The Washington Post published the so-called â€˜Pentagon Papersâ€™ in June 1971, revealing incalculable lies that had been fed to the American public about the countryâ€™s decadeslong involvement in the Vietnam War. Nixonâ€™s attempt to prevent the leaked documents from further disclosure â€“ a decision overruled by the Supreme Court â€“ exposed his character to satire and served to foreshadow the revelations to come with the Watergate break-in and the cover-up that eventually brought Nixon and his administration down. In a witty rebuttal to the Presidentâ€™s posturing, Guston caricatured Nixonâ€™s self-mythologizing identity, sly political manoeuvers, and disposable morals into a farcical cartoon canon.In the newly exhibited works from Gustonâ€™s sketchbooks, visitors to the exhibition will get a closer look at the artistâ€™s working process and the development of his imagery. They can study Gustonâ€™s parodies of the Presidentâ€™s humble upbringings and dirt-poor youth in the drawing of a locomotive engine billowing with black smoke. As the train departs from the ocean waves and exotic palm trees of the California coast, it reminds us of Nixonâ€™s determined path toward early political success. To complete the dramatic scene-setting Guston borrows the phrase, â€˜It seems like an impossible dreamâ€_â€™ from Nixonâ€™s 1968 Presidential Nomination Acceptance Speech at the Republican National Convention, and memorializes it in clouds. In sketches where Nixon himself is depicted, Guston exaggerates anatomical attributes, notably Nixonâ€™s famous five oâ€™clock shadow, defiant gaze, swollen jowls, and ever-growing nose. Nixonâ€™s â€˜schnozâ€™ is rendered as phallic morphology, becoming a visual cue for Gustonâ€™s condemnation of the Presidentâ€™s obscene deceits.While Gustonâ€™s narrative follows Nixon from his youth to his eventual resignation of the Presidency in 1974, the primary fuel for the Nixon drawings came from the events of July 1971. Encouraged by his trusted National Security Advisor, Henry Kissinger, Nixon announced plans to visit China and establish a new era of statesmanship and political relations. Dumbfounded by the hypocrisy of a man who had built his career upon a virulent anti-Communist stance, Guston conceived a slew of skits and sketches related to the voyage Nixon would take when visiting China in February of the following year. The President is depicted nose-deep in a manuscript of mock-Chinese text, scheming and plotting in preparation. As the President frolics and plans for the hoopla of a fantastical â€˜Asian Tour,â€™ never far from reach are his sidekicks Kissinger, Vice President Spiro Agnew, and Attorney General John Mitchell. As parallels to Nixonâ€™s nose, Guston dreams up personifying attributes for each of these cronies: Agnew becomes a conehead, Mitchell dourly smokes his pipe, and Kissinger is represented only by a thick pair of rimmed spectacles.Selecting 73 drawings from his scores of Nixon caricatures created in the summer of 1971, Guston mindfully edited the compositional chronology that makes up the Poor Richard series. Guston had originally intended to publish this sequence as a book, but a deep-seated ambivalence prevailed about these highly personal and politically profane works. In the three decades that followed, only a handful of the drawings â€“ images produced two years before the Watergate scandal and three before Nixonâ€™s political demise â€“ were publically seen: In 2001, the Poor Richard series of 73 drawings were at last exhibited together and published in a volume of the same name by the University of Chicago Press.Guston would return to the subject of Richard Nixon once more in his oeuvre in 1975. After Nixonâ€™s resignation under the threat of impeachment, Guston produced a final series of savage political drawings about the President. Poor Nixon is rendered as a â€˜victimâ€™ of the Watergate scandal he himself created and the revelations on the White House tapes he had ordered. The Presidentâ€™s phlebitis-afflicted leg â€“ an ailment from which he suffered severely â€“ is gargantuan, bandaged, and weighted. In the rarely exhibited painting â€˜San Clementeâ€™ (1975), Nixon, red-faced and inflamed, appears in agonizing pain, dragging himself across the California beach with a self-pitying tear rolling down his cheek. Bunkered at his â€˜Western White Houseâ€™, the former leader of the free world has become a symbol of self-disgust and shame. Completed five years before the artistâ€™s death, this remarkable painting stands a monument to despair, and a meditation on aging and mortality.",Hauser & Wirth (548 W 22nd St.),"548 W 22nd St., New York, NY 10011",,"Philip Guston â€œLaughter in the Dark, Drawings from 1971 & 1975â€ù","from November 01, 2016 to January 14, 2017","Bestiary is the product of a long fascination with Greek legents and early 19th Century photography. Based on hybrid creature descriptions and influenced by religious iconography, myth comes full circle to meet social criticism by molding monstrous archetypes into contemporary commentary. Most importantly, in this series, beasts are separated from their usually singular dimension and assume complex, tragic personalities where monsters and heroes become difficult to tell apart.","Drawing from the vast pictorial collection of the US Library of Congress, these characters posses the hunting qualities of early photography, when subjects were not camera-savvy and their awe for technology was etched in their expression as, to a certain degree, their souls were captured by the lens. Their photos became psychological portraits way before my digital intervention made them supernatural. This deformed pantheon combines widely known mythical protagonists with more obscure characters from the depths of ancient Greek sources.Bestiaries are traditionally catalogs where the natural history notes and illustration of beasts is usually accompanied by a moral lesson and this one is no different. Today, nature and science intertwine in ways that at times prove to be less than ideal and this compilation of brutes is a testament to this exact point.Viktor Koen is an award winning artist, educator and speaker.

As the name suggests, the pictures were all taken in Manhattan, in the wee hours of Sunday morning, usually after a night out on the town. If hedonism informs these images, from the bare skin and muscled bodies in many of its portraits, to the disco balls and bottles of poppers in its still lifes, itâ€™s a sensuality tempered by reflection. The faces are blissed out, maybe even a bit wan after eight or ten hours of clubbing. Black and white lends a coolness to the scenes, merging day with night, while several long exposures capture the euphoria of the club experience, but also its transience.â€œIt was in these serene moments,â€ù Renaldi writes, â€œleaving the clubs, totally spent, that a new city revealed itself to me.â€ù Renaldi is renowned for his portraits, most prominently in the acclaimed series Touching Strangers, which communicates a rich sense of its subjectsâ€™ inner lives in just a few almost unnoticeable details. That same nuance is on display here, whether itâ€™s the Offer Nissim ball cap that shades the eyes of a wasp-waisted young man whose T-shirt dangles from his pants, or the feminine curl of a single dark lock snaking across the clipped chest hair of a set of sculpted pecs. Yet itâ€™s New York that lends these portraits their unique resonanceâ€”Manhattan, represented here in a large quadtych of the boroughâ€™s ever more crowded skyline, in which thousands of lights blaze from hundreds of buildings, simultaneously evocative and anonymous.The suggestion is that clubbing isnâ€™t just transient but transcendental. Whether itâ€™s the costume or the beat or maybe just the drugs, the experience is bigger than the individual. The party started years before he made his way to the otherwise abandoned streets of Midtown West and will continue long after sheâ€™s given herself over to middle-aged bedtimes. The tensionâ€™s there in a photograph of a small, curtained stage, fairy lights arcing delicately behind translucent striped gauze. Is the showâ€”the eveningâ€”about to begin, or has it already ended? The answer is both, but also neither, because itâ€™s not the show thatâ€™s important but the interludeâ€”the knowledge that the music is always playing somewhere, even if youâ€™re not there to hear it.Also on display, in the Project Space, is Renaldiâ€™s I Want Your Love, a collection of imagery and ephemera from the 1980s to the present. I Want Your Love echoes the documentary ethos of Manhattan Sunday but on a more intimate level and over a longer period of time, and as such provides both personal historical context to the show in the main gallery.Richard Renaldi (b. 1968) was born in Chicago, Illinois, and lives in New York City. He received his BFA in photography from New York University in 1990. Exhibitions of his photographs have been mounted in galleries and museums throughout the United States, Asia, and Europe. Manhattan Sunday has already garnered praise from a variety of sources, including the Guggenheim Foundation, which awarded Renaldi a fellowship in 2015 based on the project, and the Aperture Foundation, which has published the series in book form.

Apart from the portraits, which are painted from life, all the works in this show are from the artistâ€™s imagination and memory, nourished by long walks in woods and along rivers, and by the mindâ€™s journeys through history and legend. People and nature, and subjects full of action and emotion, take shape in baroque rhythms and moving chiaroscuro.From the start of a painting, Reid is especially intent on achieving a quality of color which will be subtle and mysterious yet powerful. The color effect should convey the emotion of the scene first of all. Then the color relationships ought to set up a movement and establish the space within the painting. The linear aspects of the drawing fall into place amid the rhythms set up by the colors. It is of utmost importance to Mr. Reid that each painting unfolds rhythmically and organically. It must pulsate with life, its own life, not simply the mode of existence the artist willed for it but something more, something that surprises even the painter and that is all its own, never seen before.Besides painting, Reid loves to teach and lecture about art, and has served on the Fine Arts faculty at the Fashion Institute of Technology in New York City, the Art Sudents League, and the New York Academy ofArt. He has lectured numerous times at Parsons School ofDesign, the New York Studio School, and at art schools and universities around the country. His lecture subjects range from â€œArt and Metaphysicsâ€ù (at Oregon State University) to â€œA structural Comparison of Tintorettoâ€™s Raising of Lazarus and Seuratâ€™s Evening, Honfleurâ€ù (at the New York Studio School). Mr. Reidâ€™s work has been shown extensively in galleries, schools and museums on the East and West Coasts, and he has done many paintings and murals for churches. His studio is in Bushwick.The Main Gallery will also be dedicated to exhibiting new work by Craig Manister. Manisterâ€™s path, from his early work as an abstractionist and former student of Pat Passlof and Milton Resnick, was enhanced by extensive European travel to see many seminal paintings in person, and developed in stages toward making paintings of things in the real world. The new paintings continue to exploit issues raised while teaching a class in still life painting in order to find resolutions to the problems students were finding themselves in with their paintings. The work is perceptual in approach, hence the subtitle of the exhibition Slow Looking. Manister tells students that while we can see well enough to pass down the hallways without walking into the walls, that in itself does not constitute the kind of seeing necessary for painting. A successful painting is like alchemy, as it filters perceptual phenomena with classical formal qualities, art historical precedents and a truce of opposites, to find an unexpected pictorial solution of opposing forces. When a painting finds itself itâ€™s magical. It becomes a marriage of disparate qualities to form a unity that is beautiful but pictorially coherent.Among the places, Manister has shown work are the National Academy Museum, Beijing Art Institute, Mei Shu Guan Art Museum, Elizabeth Harris Gallery, New York Studio School, Staten Island Museum, Newhouse Center for Contemporary Art, Neilsen Gallery, Farleigh Dickinson University, Wagner College, Ober Gallery, and the Gallery of the College of Staten Island/CUNY. He was included in After the Fall; A Survey of Abstract Painting Since 1970, curated by Lily Wei, at the Newhouse Center for Contemporary Art in 1996. The current exhibition is the fourth time Manister has shown a body of work at The Painting Center.Manister was born in New York City and currently lives and maintains a studio on Staten Island. He earned a BS degree at Richmond College/CUNY and then spent two years at the New York Studio School. He completed an MFA degree later at Brooklyn College/CUNY. He teaches studio painting at the College of Staten Island/CUNY.The Painting Center is also pleased to present Town and Country: Paintings by Caren Canier in the Project Room. Caren Canierâ€™s paintings, executed in mixed media including collaged photographs and paint, are musings about the way people inhabit the landscape, rural or urban. Social norms and relationships transcend the linear conventions of history in these paintings, confounding inhabitants from different times, places and memories. The artist borrows freely from historic and contemporary sources to orchestrate unexpected and curious meetings between past and present dwellers, whether commonplace or idealized.â€œWest Hallâ€ù is a reverie about the parking lot of the Arts Building at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, perched above the Hudson River Valley in Troy, NY, where Canier teaches. Here, Elie Nadelmanâ€™s sculpted figures, Edweard Muybridgeâ€™s figures in motion and a wooden Sienese saint from the Renaissance, comingle among the parked cars. The mundane, contemporary site is populated by unlikely commuters and set in the context of the majestic expanse of the Hudson River Valley beyond.â€œAlbergo Soleâ€ù, offers a view from a hotel window in Rome, in which a Nadelman head looks down on an urban piazza, alive with ancient Roman figures, Edweard Muybridgeâ€™s 19th century figures in motion and Nadelmanâ€™s sculpture of the 1920â€™s. The lineage from ancient to modern Rome to the New World of Nadelman and the transience of life in the hotel are evocative of collective memories of the Grand Tour undertaken by artists, writers and intellectuals since the 17th century.â€œBendicÃ_â€™s Fallâ€ù is in homage to â€œThe Leopardâ€ù by Giuseppe Tomasi di Lampedusa and Lucchino Visconti. Lampedusa wrote the novel, Visconti made the film and here, as the famous ball scene swirls around the picture plane, the actors, director, Garibaldi and his Redshirts meet for a mashup in the Sicilian landscape. BendicÃ_, the faithful dog, who appears in the closing paragraph of the novel, falls both physically and metaphorically. The actual making of the film becomes a part of the historic context, emphasizing the timelessness of the work of art.The series â€œThe Nadelmans Frequent the Stettheimersâ€ù, chronicles an imaginary visit by Nadelman figures to the renowned dollhouse of Carrie Stettheimer, constructed in the 1930â€™s and now housed in the Museum of the City of New York. Collaged skyscrapers painted by Charles Sheeler surround the dollhouse and its occupants. These tableaus speak to the social norms of New York society and intelligentsia of the period.
Finally, the McC paintings are in homage to the landscape of rural upstate New York and itâ€™s citizenry through time. Here, classical figures of the ancient world that informed 19th century architecture and artifacts, mix with Shakers and soccer moms to reflect the artistâ€™s experience of life upstate.Caren Canier is a native ofNew York City, educated at Cornell University and Boston University.

This is Andersonâ€™s second solo show with the gallery.","Hurvin Andersonâ€™s paintings depict places where memory and history converge. He works from drawings, photographs and his own recollections to re-imagine complex spaces emblematic of individual and cultural significance. Andersonâ€™s newest paintings move toward abstraction, suggesting boundaries and shifting viewpoints, creating a sensation akin to a flicker of memory. Raised in Birmingham, UKâ€™s African-Caribbean community during the 1970s Andersonâ€™s worldview was shaped by his immersion in two distinct cultures. Their intersection provides the artist a platform for painterly invention and subtle meditations on larger themes of social history and identity.This summer New Art Exchange in Nottingham, UK, presented Dub Versions, a solo exhibition of Andersonâ€™s new and recent paintings paired with related source materials to illustrate the artistâ€™s uniquely forensic approach to image-making. Also in 2016 Anderson was the subject of Backdrop at Art Gallery of Ontario, an in-depth survey exhibition featuring previously unseen paintings, sculptures, photographs and large-scale works on paper.

â€” John McLaughlin

Van Doren Waxter presents Marvelous Void, an exhibition of seven paintings completed between 1948-1974 by the post World War II abstractionist John McLaughlin (1898-1976). Conceived and curated by Robert C. Morgan, this specific investigation into the purely abstract work of John McLaughlin will open November 2, 2016 and remain on view through January 7, 2017. The exhibition title derives from Sesshu Toyo, a 15th Century Japanese artist and Zen monk, whose approach to ink painting introduced the concept of â€œemptinessâ€ù or the â€œmarvelous voidâ€ù into Japanese painting, ultimately influencing the work of the American painter five hundred year later. According to Professor Morgan: â€œThe use of empty space moves through the paintings of Sesshu in a way that echoes the natural living environment as a seemingly infinite space. It was this idea that caught the attention of McLaughlin early on, and stayed with him throughout his career.â€ù

This would prove deeply influential to McLaughlin in determining the use of rectilinear space as a â€œneutral structureâ€ù in his own hard-edge paintings. This unique exhibition will feature a selection of McLaughlinâ€™s geometric abstractions alongside two early Japanese ink paintings that exemplify Sesshuâ€™s concept. Marvelous Void represents the first time this connection between McLaughlinâ€™s practice and Sesshuâ€™s influence has been realized in an exhibition. McLaughlinâ€™s practice was devoted, in part, to reconciling Western sensibilities with Eastern notions of space, a deviation from the ideas and tempestuous style prominent in Abstract Expressionism. Enamored with Sesshuâ€™s manipulation of the negative space between objects, McLaughlin further distilled the spatial plane, reducing crisp, ordered forms so that the viewerâ€™s perception is augmented. The supremacy of openness that McLaughlin identified in both Eastern painting and Zen Buddhist teachings was resolved in his own canvases through an awareness and hierarchy of spaceâ€”an optical berth, he argued, necessary for substantial introspection. While the sparseness of McLaughlinâ€™s forms is informed by the â€œmarvelous void,â€ù his reduced and layered constructions owe some debt to Western modernists such as Mondrian and Malevich. However, for McLaughlin, there were distinct differences.

Emphasizing these differences, the Curator states in his catalog essay: â€œThis Eastern idea does not separate the conceptual from the material world, nor, for that matter, does it isolate the conceptual from the visual presence of color and form or make distinctions between the process of thought and the resonance of form.â€ù The structure of the works on viewâ€”sharply defined vertical and horizontal bars bisecting color fieldsâ€”are forceful, yet manage to elicit a meditative quality. McLaughlin confronts the Western preoccupation with the image by isolating and amplifying perception and space into pure abstractions with a profound connection to nature.","John McLaughlin was an American abstract painter born in Sharon, MA in 1898. In 1935, McLaughlin and his wife Florence Emerson (descendant of Ralph Waldo Emerson) moved to Japan where they lived for three years. Upon their return in 1938, McLaughlin established a business dealing Japanese prints. It was around this time that he decided to start painting, which was brought to a halt just a few years later with the start of the War. Fluent in Japanese, McLaughlin was recruited as a translator by the Army during WWII. After the war, McLaughlin settled in Dana Point, California, where he started painting full time in 1946. Entirely self-taught, the artist continued to paint, with considerable success in his later career, until his death in 1976. He is currently the subject of a major retrospective at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art (November 13, 2016-April 16, 2017).

Robert C. Morgan met and began corresponding with John McLaughlin from 1969 to 1974. Their age difference was nearly fifty years. Morgan went on to get a Master of Fine Arts degree and a Ph.D. in Art History. In 1999, he was awarded the first Arcale prize in International Art Criticism in Salamanca, and the same year served on the UNESCO jury at the 48th Biennale di Venezia. In 2003, Dr. Morgan was appointed Professor Emeritus in art history at the Rochester Institute of Technology, and, in 2011, was inducted into the European Academy of Sciences and Arts, Salzburg. In addition to his scholarly career with books translated into Chinese, Farsi, and Korean, he continues to work and exhibit as a painter.",Van Doren Waxter,"23 E 73rd St New York, NY 10021",,John McLaughlin â€œMarvelous Voidâ€ù,"from November 02, 2016 to January 07, 2017",Ashok Jain Gallery presents â€œCosmic Consciousnessâ€ù by Laura McClanahan.,"â€œConfluence is the meeting of two rivers or ideas. In this series of paintings, I am exploring the integration of mark making and poured paint. My paintings create flow patterns that stream off the edge on various angles forming movement to the stars or a decent to the earth. My current research is of minerals, and what water carries and reveals from the earth. These flow patterns are made by pouring paint in thin layers so that the various media create resistances and then flow around the objects in their path. I make the metaphor of water patterns to our patterns of behavior and consciousness. If we are in the flow or not and what is blocking our way. Sometimes we need an aid in unblocking our energy, for this I have added gold paint, quartz and ink to the mix. The gold is symbolically conductive, precious and luminous. The glow of gold brings the feeling of enrichment and abundance. In some paintings I mixed the quartz crystals with resin to create a scalar field. When quartz is squeezed it creates a one-second pulsation and is used in watches for keeping time. The second count is not a construct, but a natural rhythm of the universe and helps people to be in synchronicity with the world around them.â€ù - Laura McClanahan",Ashok Jain Gallery,"58 Hester St., New York, NY 10002",,Laura McClanahan â€œCosmic Consciousnessâ€ù,"from November 02, 2016 to November 28, 2016","Danziger Gallery announces its representation of the acclaimed British painter Annie Kevans.

Nicholson grew up in 30s Brooklyn, became a top model and fashion icon in the Paris of the 50s and was a core member of Warholâ€™s Factory entourage in the 60s. More recently, sheâ€™s lived hand-to- mouth, moving often, sometimes homeless. Through the collaboration between Nicholson and Ventur, the former Superstar has again become a muse to an artist, and she relishes her return to the limelight. She presents herself, her twins Gunther and Penelope and her daily routine, through venues, vignettes and styling.Venturâ€™s ongoing project of re-capturing the Warhol Superstars as they are now has resulted in unblinking and lyrical portraits of some of the most fascinating personalities of the 60â€™s and 70â€™s: Taylor Mead, Billy Name, and Mario Montez, for example. In each case, the project has followed the pace of a sensitive duet in which Ventur allows for a conceptual flexibility that shares the balance of creativity between photographer and subject-allowing for the otherness and signature aesthetic choices of both to emerge through the works. The Superstars were proto-reality stars who cultivated oversize gestures and clichÃ©, seeking to both live a contrived drama and a natural life simultaneously. Ventur deftly manages to capture the authentic individuals and their fabricated existences in his photographs.Conrad Ventur is an artist working in photography, video, and installation. Since 2000, Ventur has consistently taken immensely personal and instinctive photographs of his subjects - often those under threat of being forgotten or rewritten over time. The artistâ€™s working process mirrors that of an ethnographer; immersing himself within these relationships for extended periods, Venturâ€™s photographs reveal an intimacy and trust, and are ultimately personal documents of both the subject and the artist.

The galleryâ€™s second exhibition with the Chinese artist will be shown in both its New York locations. Each space will feature an installation alongside new paintings in which Liu Wei continues his examination of the physiological and psychological conditions that shape reality.

Over the past two decades, Liu Wei has resisted commitment to a specific medium or way of making, choosing instead to work with a wide range of media that facilitates the conceptual nature of his work. While many of his paintings, sculptures, installations, and videos reference Chinese culture and its modern landscape, his focus lies in universal issues affecting contemporary society, such as the transformative effect of urbanization on the landscape and unbalanced hierarchies of authority. Liu Wei approaches these concepts with an open mind, without imparting a particular political line of thinking. As part of the post-Mao generation, the artist has expressed how the rapid development of China and the constant shifting of ideology and values created an uncertain state of reality, which has deeply informed his artistic pursuits. Central to Liu Weiâ€™s practice is his manipulation and alteration of perception as a tool to create environments where viewers encounter a complex and varied existence.

For his sculptural installation at 536 West 22nd Street, Liu Wei was inspired by the Jorge Luis Borges poem Mirrors (1960), particularly the segment that reads, â€œâ€_Everything happens and nothing is recorded, In these rooms of the looking glassâ€_.â€ù The monumental sculptureâ€”comprised of mirrors that form a single, floating boxâ€”passes through walls and blocks off established pathways of the gallery as a way to drastically alter the existing architecture and the experience of the space. For Liu Wei, the presence of the viewer, who will be able to circumnavigate the box, is as important to the installation as the physical and material characteristics of the sculpture. The piece is intended to provoke a phenomenological experience of space that can be only activated by the viewer.

Architecture has long been a source of inspiration for the artist, as one of the defining characteristics of both modernity and urbanism. This is echoed in the gray monochromatic paintings also installed at West 22nd Street. The thick, tactile impasto of oil paint applied like rough plaster to the canvas recalls industrial building materials, while a series of metal bars installed in front of the paintings creates a visual and conceptual disruption to the viewing experience. This metal barrier, like the mirrored sculpture, provides a framing structure for the paintings, while also activating the viewerâ€™s awareness of their physical presence within the space, as a consumer of visual information.

At Chrystie Street, Liu Wei builds upon his concern for activating space with a complex installation composed of objects made from military canvas, metal, and wood. Surrounding the installation is a series of colorful, irregularly shaped paintings on steel that resemble views of the horizon. This entire installation is intimately linked to Liu Weiâ€™s fascination with the ways technology has enhanced and altered our understanding of the world. His representation is fragmented and disjointed in a way that mimics how we receive and process information. Liu Weiâ€™s work suggests that the illusion of a panoramic view of the world drastically alters our own perception of reality, which is no longer simply informed by our immediate locale.","Liu Wei (b. 1972, Beijing; lives and works in Beijing) graduated from the National Academy of Fine Arts, Hangzhou in 1996. Liu Weiâ€™s work has been featured in international exhibitions, most recently at the Qatar Museum, Doha (2016); Fondation Louis Vuitton, Paris (2016); PLATEAU, Samsung Museum of Art, Seoul (2016); the Ullens Center for Contemporary Art, Beijing (2015); the Rubell Collection, Miami (2014); Long Museum, Shanghai (2014); Minsheng Art Museum, Shanghai (2011); Centre Pompidou, Paris (2010); National Art Museum of China, Beijing (2010); Ullens Center for Contemporary Art, Beijing (2010); Long March Space, Beijing (2010); Saatchi Gallery, London (2008); Bonniers Kunsthall, Stockholm; and Mudam Luxembourg, France (2008), to name a few.

While each artist is known for their prescribed disciplines (painting for Dickinson and performance for Knowles), their practices are both flush with works that incorporate paper. The exhibition showcases how the artists push traditional uses of the medium and display the multifarious ways paper can be exploited.","The artistâ€™s share their focus on the everyday for subject matter. Using the media of paper Dickinson concentrates on seemingly mundane moments protruding underneath a door or beaming behind a curtain to construct her such as light worksâ€™ compositions. Knowles may focus on utilitarian objects such as a shoe or a bean and contain these materials in paper-like substances such as flax or cotton. Each artist likes to open their workâ€™s dialogue to encompass the time, labor, space, and poetics of daily life. The medium projects beyond itâ€™s two-dimensional construct and is utilized as a physical entity that often becomes sculptural. Knowlesâ€™s Bean Turners are comprised of large homemade pieces of paper, often in hues of burgundy or grey, adhered together with dried beans placed inside. The objects are open tools for performance that can be activated by the artist or the audience. Producing a sound similar to that of a rainstick, the work is at once a device for percussion and meditation.Dickinsonâ€™s works on paper, exhibited framed without glass, showcase the medium as a tactile surface with subtle dimension. Floating within itâ€™s frame, the works are created through the use of tools and processes not generally associated with pieces completed on paper. As the paper is worked on from both sides and picked at, chiseled, rubbed, and worn through, traditional materials such as graphite, gouache, and pastel are layered in unconventional methods. The end results are pieces whose presence resonates as steel, fabric, or concrete. For both artists the material serves as a platform for performance. Working on a piece for months, sometimes years at a time, Dickinsonâ€™s works on paper are composed from the accumulative tracings of her studio process. The artist will place the paper on the floor of her studio, allowing its surface to absorb both her and othersâ€™ movements. Compositions materialize through chance rather than orchestration.For Knowles every work has the potential to initiate a performance. Including the aforementioned Bean Turners, other series include Event Threads that are composed of fragments of paper among other things. These pieces behave as sculptural compositions, since Knowles views their elements like musical notes. Other pieces by Knowles often contain images or literal artifacts from the artistâ€™s personal and studio life. Therefore, like Dickinson, the pieces presented within the gallery showcase a sort of archive of their lives. Thus, surpassing the literal two-dimensionality of paper, these artists exhibit how this ubiquitous medium can be transformed.",James Fuentes LLC,"55 Delancey St., New York, NY 10002",,Alison Knowles & Jessica Dickinson Exhibition,"from November 01, 2016 to November 20, 2016","Ceres Gallery presents Intertwine.

- Benjamin Franklin
â€”Poor Richardâ€™s Almanack
1732-1758

Maccarone presents A Man Full of Trouble, the galleryâ€™s first exhibition with Philadelphia-based artist Alex Da Corte.

Da Corteâ€™s current exhibition takes its name from the Pre-Revolutionary war tavern that stands in the heart of Philadelphiaâ€™s historic district. Using the â€œprivyâ€ù, an archeological and scatological pit located near the â€œA Man Full of Troubleâ€ù tavern, as inspiration, Da Corte presents the world within such a portal; a place where memories, objects, past, and present aggregate and reconstitute.

Collapsing the space between the psychological iconography of his outer Philadelphia upbringing and the cultural touchstones often used to define those suburban boundaries, Da Corte transforms 630 Greenwich Streetâ€™s exhibition space with a menagerie of interrelated sculptures staged atop a carpet depicting a cinematic moment of foiled discovery, begging the existential questions of the difference between chasing fantasy and chasing delusion.

Several works in Da Corteâ€™s tableau feature replicas or retooled iconographic components of Philadelphiaâ€™s culture and history: John Cramâ€™s fan chair, William Pennâ€™s likeness on the Quaker Oats container, local business murals, or the ever-present inventions and avuncular presence of Benjamin Franklin. Other works are poetically staged amalgams of the familiar and the absurd interwoven with personal narratives of love, loss, success, and escapism, providing a kaleidoscopic portrait of the artist and his city.

Alex Da Corte was born in Camden, New Jersey, in 1980. He received a Bachelor of Fine Arts from the University of the Arts, Philadelphia, and a Master of Fine Arts from the Yale University School of Art. His survey exhibition â€œFree Rosesâ€ù is currently on view at MASS MoCA, North Adams.

Da Corteâ€™s work will also be included in the group exhibition â€œDreamlands: Immersive Cinema and Art, 1905â€“2016â€ù at the Whitney Museum of American Art, New York (Opening Oct. 28, 2016).

â€“ Josef Albers, Interaction of Color

David Zwirner presents the galleryâ€™s first exhibition dedicated to the work of Josef Albers since having announced its representation of The Josef and Anni Albers Foundation. The exhibition will take place at the galleryâ€™s 537 West 20th Street location and will present a selection of works that explore Albersâ€™s use of black, white, and grey across the full breadth of his career.

Josef Albers is considered one of the most influential abstract painters of the twentieth century, as well as an important designer and educator noted for his rigorously experimental approach to spatial relationships and color theory. The exhibitionâ€™s title is taken from a passage in Interaction of Color (1963), Albersâ€™s significant treatise on color studies and an essential handbook for artists and teachers. Particularly concerned with the study of chromatic interaction, in which visual perception of a color is affected by those adjacent to it, Albers writes, â€œTo this end, we study gradation by producing so-called grey steps, grey scales, grey ladders. These demonstrate a gradual stepping up or down between white and black, between lighter and darker.â€ù1

The centrality of these gradations between black, white, and grey to Albersâ€™s overall theory of color is demonstrated by the inclusion of his first Homage to the Square painting, Homage to the Square (A) (1950), which inaugurated the series that would occupy him until his death in 1976. Establishing the configuration of nested squares for which the series is known, the work moves progressively from deep black at its center to pale grey at its edge. In addition to this key painting and its related studies, the exhibition will also present a range of works in a variety of media that attest to Albersâ€™s lifelong investigation into black, white, and grey, from ink and watercolor works on paper that pre-date his time at the Bauhaus, to gouaches executed during his tenure at Black Mountain College, to color studies that shed light on his working process. Known primarily for his intensive exploration of color, Albers often utilized tones of black, white, and grey while working out new ideas and new techniques, crafting finely tuned studies of light and perception while emphasizing the graphic and rhythmic qualities of his compositions. Examples of this tendency include not only the first Homage to the Square, mentioned above, but also earlier works, among them his series of Treble Clefs (1932-35)â€”important gouaches that bridge the period from his departure from the Bauhaus to his arrival in Americaâ€”and selections from his Kinetics series of the early 1940s.

The gallery is also preparing a major exhibition of the work of Josef Albers that will open in January 2017 at David Zwirnerâ€™s London location.

Josef Albers (1888-1976) was born in Bottrop, Germany, and studied briefly at the KÃ¶nigliche Bayerische Akademie der Bildenden Kunst, Munich in 1919 before becoming a student at the Weimar Bauhaus in 1920. In 1922, Albers joined the schoolâ€™s faculty, first teaching stained glass and eventually teaching design as well. In 1933, he and Anni Albers emigrated to North Carolina, where they both began to teach at Black Mountain College. During their time at Black Mountain, Albers began to show his work extensively within the United States, including solo exhibitions at Addison Museum of American Art, Andover (1935); J.B. Neumannâ€™s New Art Circle, New York (1936, 1938); The Germanic Museum at Harvard University, Cambridge (1936); the Katharine Kuh Gallery, Chicago (1937); the San Francisco Museum of Art (1940); and the Nierendorf Gallery, New York (1941). The Alberses remained at Black Mountain until 1950, when they moved to New Haven, Connecticut, where Josef Albers was invited to direct the department of design at Yale University School of Art. In 1949, he developed what would become his seminal Homage to the Square series, which he continued to elaborate until his death in 1976. This body of work was featured in a major exhibition organized by The Museum of Modern Art, New York in 1963 that traveled to 11 venues in the United States and 11 venues in Latin America. Albers retired from teaching in 1958, just prior to the publication of his important Interaction of Color (1963), which was reissued in an expanded format in 2013. Following numerous gallery and museum exhibitions, as well as his participation in documenta 1 (1955) and documenta 4 (1968), Albers became the first living artist to be the subject of a solo exhibition at the Metropolitan Museum of Art with his career-spanning retrospective there in 1971.

More recent exhibitions include Painting On Paper: Josef Albers In America, which originated at the Pinakothek der Moderne, Munich, in 2010 (traveled to Josef Albers Museum, Quadrat, Bottrop, Germany; Louisiana Museum of Modern Art, HumlebÃ_k, Denmark; Kunstmuseum Basel; Centre Pompidou, Paris; Centro de Arte Moderna, Gulbenkian Museum, Lisbon; and the Morgan Library and Museum, New York); Josef Albers: Minimal Means, Maximum Effect, at the FundaciÃ_n Juan March, Madrid, in 2014 (traveled to Henie Onstad Art Centre, HÃ¸vikodden, Norway); and A Beautiful Confluence: Anni and Josef Albers and the Latin American World at Mudec, Museo delle Culture, Milan, in 2015-2016. The MusÃ©e dâ€™Art Moderne de la Ville de Paris is planning a major survey exhibition of the work of both Josef and Anni Albers for 2019.",,David Zwirner 20th Street,"537 W 20th St., New York NY 10011",,"Josef Albers â€œGrey Steps, Grey Scales, Grey Laddersâ€ù","from November 03, 2016 to December 17, 2016","Storefront for Art and Architecture, in collaboration with the New York Comedy Festival (NYCF), has commissioned Jonah Freeman and Justin Lowe to create Paranoia Man in a Rat Fink Room at Storefrontâ€™s gallery space.

Paranoia Man in a Rat Fink Room.","Paranoia Man In A Rat Fink Room follows a tradition of spatial experimentation at Storefront where the boundaries between architecture, art, and the subject are dissolved into one continuous environment. The installation is a historical pastiche of urban and architectural experiences linked through a mise-en-scÃ¨ne comprised of three architectural environments - a Canal Street style kiosk filled with the leftover DVDs and VHSs from Jungle Video (a now defunct media superstore in Los Angeles); a comedy club partially inspired by the original Rat Fink Room (the worldâ€™s first dedicated stand-up comedy club, which opened in 1963); and a bathroom that has been converted into surveillance headquarters that will keep audio/video recordings of the last days of Storefront.ABOUT PARANOIA MAN IN A RAT FINK ROOM
Storefront for Art and Architecture is closing its doors for good. The real estate vultures have descended to feed on the malnourished carcass of its signature Kenmare Street space. Its replacement will most likely be a Juice Press supplement administered through fiber-optic eyeliner. The official announcement is that it will be something called SAN SAN. A flagship store for BAMA Cosmetic Pharmaceuticals, OCTOPUS Entheobotanical Data Networks and Fata Morgana Entertainment Systems brought to you in a fancy new package designed by interior starchitect Henri Erkins. â€œA multiplatform consumer experience where virtual and tactile interaction merge in a new marketing sphere.â€ù A kind of combination Pizza Hut-Taco Bell-Google Daydream for the Lower Manhattan demographic. But before the polish of recycled paper, space rock and smartphone flirtation brings the point of purchase orgasms Jonah Freeman and Justin Lowe have arranged for an interim scenario.The over stock of Jungle Video, the now defunct media superstore you may remember from your drive to LAX via La Tijera Blvd., is coming to Storefront for Art and Architecture for a fire sale of such gray market classics as Linguini is Not a Flower and Thank God For My Forties. A Canal Street style kiosk of bootleg handbags and toxic perfume will stage a pop-up shop for all manner of DVD, VHS, Compact Disc, Louis Vuitton, Calvin Klein, Prada and perhaps a dime bag of heavily stepped on cocaine if you know the password. But this will only be the first stop on the path to the headlining act: a reprisal of the infamous Rat Fink Room.The Rat Fink Room, the first dedicated stand-up comedy club on planet earth, opened in September 1963 on 50th St. and 3rd Ave in New York City. Itâ€™s proprietors Morris Levy and Jackie Kannon imagined an ad hoc gathering place where two-bit insult comics settled scores and â€œworking blueâ€ù pushed the limits of good taste.Jackie Kannon, its ringmeister, was a mobbed-up sycophant comic, who felt pressured to buy himself a nose job in the hope of breaking out of the borscht belt. He was not even dimly aware of what might be at stake in the obscenity trials of the time, around such now classic works as Howl and Naked Lunch. For him, working blue was about the money. Morris â€œThe Octopusâ€ù Levy, the founder of Birdland and Roulette Records, was a mob connected music business executive who is mostly remembered as a crook who stole from recording artists, was convicted of extortion and suspected of heroin distribution. Levy used the Rat Fink Room and his other venues as a place to surreptitiously record comedy acts and release records without the comicsâ€™ permission. He gave them no portion of the proceeds and threatened bodily harm if they sued. In the spirit of this, Freeman and Lowe have converted the neighborâ€™s bathroom (Staci age 12 addicted to synthetic marijuana) into a surveillance headquarters that will keep audio/video recordings of the last days of Storefront.The Rat Fink Room will be alive again in the twilight of Storefront for Art and Architecture through a series of nights programmed by Caroline Hirsch and the New York Comedy Festival from November 2nd to November 6th.It is true the New York City of the 20th century imagination is gone and never to return.
